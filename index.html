        <p class="paragraph">The MBTA, Boston's public transportation system, is a central part of living in Boston. 
            As the main way many people travel, 
            analyzing the MBTA shows how people flow through the city 
            and what is important to them. Is there a larger number of riders 
            when the Red Sox are playing? Do people stay in during the colder or rainier months, 
            so ridership will be less, or are fewer people walking and biking, so ridership will be more? 
            What line is the most popular, and does that change throughout the year? 
            Which stops are the most popular, showing the hubs of Boston?
            Looking into how people travel can help us answer these deeper questions 
            about city life to give a better understanding of what life is like in Boston. </p>
